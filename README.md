This end to end project started with the problem: Shop Easy, the online retailer, has been losing client engagement in 3 ways: social media, site views to conversions, and through their reviews.

The database with my initial tables were from the marketing and research team.

Attached in this project:
  The SQL Queries I made
  My script for the sentiment analysis I made with python
  The output CSV adding sentiment score, sentiment category, and sentiment buckets for use in Power BI
  Screencaps of the dashboard and data model I made using Microsoft Power BI
  The market analysis report showing my findings
